## Organizing Documentation into Projects

You create projects to categorize docs logically. Each project acts as a workspace with pages, subpages, and folders.

  <Step title="Create Project" icon="plus">
    Navigate to `https://dashboard.example.com/projects` and click "New Project".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Pages" icon="file-text">
    Inside the project, create pages using the "+" button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Structure Folders">
    Drag pages into folders for hierarchy.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Version Control and History Tracking

Every edit creates a version. You view history, compare changes, and restore previous versions.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="View History" icon="clock">
    Click the history icon on any page to see timelines.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Compare Versions" icon="git-compare">
    Select two versions to see diffs side-by-side.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Restore" icon="undo">
    Revert to any version with one click.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<CodeGroup tabs="API,CLI">
  ```javascript
  // Fetch page history via API
  const history = await fetch('https://api.example.com/projects/{projectId}/pages/{pageId}/history', {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${YOUR_TOKEN}` }
  });
  ```
  ```bash
  # CLI command to list versions
  vyacheslav history --project {projectId} --page {pageId}
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Collaboration and Sharing Options

Invite team members and set permissions. You share public links or embed docs.

<Expandable title="Permission Levels" default-open="true">
  - Viewer: Read-only access
  - Editor: Modify content
  - Admin: Manage members and settings
</Expandable>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use role-based access to control who edits sensitive docs.
</Callout>

## Search and Tagging Functionalities

Tag pages for organization and use full-text search across projects.

| Feature | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Tags | Add custom labels | `#api`, `#frontend` |
| Search | Keyword or advanced filters | `status: draft tag:api` |
| Filters | By project, date, author | Date range picker |

## Exporting and Publishing Docs

Publish projects to a custom domain or export to PDF/Markdown.

<Request tabs="JavaScript,cURL" show-lines="true">
  ```javascript
  const publish = await fetch('https://api.example.com/projects/{projectId}/publish', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${YOUR_TOKEN}` },
    body: JSON.stringify({ domain: 'docs.vyacheslav.space' })
  });
  ```
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://api.example.com/projects/{projectId}/publish \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
    -d '{"domain": "docs.vyacheslav.space"}'
  ```
</Request>

<Response tabs="200">
  ```json
  {
    "status": "published",
    "url": "https://docs.vyacheslav.space",
    "formats": ["html", "pdf"]
  }
  ```
</Response>

## Best Practices
