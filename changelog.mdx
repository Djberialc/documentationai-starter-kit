## Migration Guide

For breaking changes like attribute quoting, update your MDX files:

```bash
# Find and replace single quotes in JSX
find docs -name "*.mdx" -exec sed -i "s/title='\(.*\)'/title=\"\1\"/g" {} \;
```

This ensures compatibility with v1.1.0+. Test pages after migration to confirm no parsing errors.
